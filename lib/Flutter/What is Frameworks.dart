###🔧 What is a Framework (General Meaning)?
A framework is a pre-built set of code that provides a structure and common functionality for building software applications. It helps developers by:
- Providing ready-made components (like buttons, layouts, animations)
-  Handling complex tasks (navigation, state management)
- Encouraging best practices and code structure

🧱 What is a Framework in Simple Words?
A framework is like a ready-made toolbox for building apps.

Imagine you want to build a house (your app) 🏠.

A programming language (like Dart) gives you bricks and cement.

A framework (like Flutter) gives you pre-built tools, like windows, doors, and even room designs!

So you don’t have to build everything from scratch.

🧁 In Flutter:
Flutter is a UI framework that helps you build apps easily by giving you:

✅ Pre-made widgets (like buttons, text fields, sliders)
✅ Tools for layout (like Rows, Columns)
✅ Animation tools
✅ Navigation system (pages/screens)
✅ Design systems (Material for Android look, Cupertino for iOS look)

🔍 Example:
Let’s say you want a button.

Without a framework:
You’d have to draw the shape, add tap detection, animate it, etc.

With Flutter framework:
Just use ElevatedButton() — it’s already made for you!

🧠 Think of Flutter Framework Like:
Real World	Flutter Equivalent
LEGO Set	Flutter Framework
LEGO Blocks	Widgets (like buttons, text)
Instruction Manual	Flutter’s rules and structure

📦 Final Simple Definition:
A framework is a set of tools and building blocks that helps you make apps faster, easier, and better, without writing everything from zero.
